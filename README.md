# 3DRenderer (Java)
A Simple Java program that renders polygon files to which is then turned into a 3D shape.
This was a COMP261 Assignment. The program uses a Z-Buffer Algorithm to compute the pixels
of the polygons (ie. which polygons are on top), then computes the shading of each polygon
based on the ambient light and reflectivity of the light source, then draws (using EdgeLists)
the polygons that are supposed to be visible. The output is a 3D-looking shape that can be
rotated on the X, Y and Z rotations.

It has the necessary source and data files in order to be executed.
